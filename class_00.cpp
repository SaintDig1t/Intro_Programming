#include <iostream> // <- preprocessor directive 
using namespace std; // <- which namespace to use 

int main(void) // <- beggining of functions named main
{ // <- main block begins  
    cout << "!!! Hello World !!! \n" ; // < - output statement 
    cout << "!!! Hello bro !!! \n" ;
    return 0; // <- send 0 to operating system 
} // <- main block ends 



// Professor uses iostream not cstdio

// There must always be a function called main ()
// Executim always begins with the first statement in function 
// Any other function in your program are subprograms and are not executed until they are called
// main function is always an integer 
// cout is the only line of program that causes anything to be printed on screen 
// a program is a set of instructions for the computer 
//semicolon is requires to mark the end of a complete statement 
//return 0 indicates the program was successful
